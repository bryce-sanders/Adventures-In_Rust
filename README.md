# Overview

This project marks my very first venture into the use of the Rust programming language. In completing this project, I have the opportunity, not only to learn an emerging and increasingly useful programming language, but also to demonstrate that I can pick up the basics of new coding languages quickly.

This program does some basic math. It prompts the user to select either addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. It then asks the user for numbers “a” and “b”. The program then performs the chosen mathematical expression on the numbers. The solution will then replace “a” and the expression is performed continuously until the answer exceeds the absolute value of 1,000. It then informs the user how many times the expression needed to be performed.

I am undertaking this project to help me to further my academic progress.

# Development Environment

This program was developed in Visual Studio Code

The program is written in Rust

# Useful Websites

The following links lead to resources that helped me in learning to use Rust for the first time:
* [Patrick Bluth YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SigbqtVQnyI) The best settup tutorial I could find for using Rust for the first time.
* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn) Rust's official website with lots of helpful documentation.
* [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/variables-in-rust/) Helpful in understanding the basics of Rust
* [Caleb Barnhart YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Qrz15tVfk) One of my classmates! I was really stuck on why my while loop wan't ending. Reviewing his video helped me discover the trim() method I needed to get the strings to match.

# Future Work

Things I would like to work on in the future:
* I would like to get integers from the user! This is a very important function of my program that I could not figure out!
* I would like to clean up the terminal in the future. The text displayed is a bit messy.
* I would like to better understand Rust in general! I can tell that it's a super powerful language but it's got a steep learning curve.
